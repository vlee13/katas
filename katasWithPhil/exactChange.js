// Write a function that takes 1 number (1-100) and returns the smallest combination of coins that equal that number
// for example exactChange(77)
// would return [25, 25, 25, 1, 1]
// so 25 cents, another 25 cents, another 25 cents, 1 penny and 1 penny
// exactChange(12) would return [10, 1, 1]
// 10 cents, 1 penny, 1 penny
// if u return [5, 5, 1, 1] that would be incorrect because [10, 1, 1] uses fewer coins
